# Issue Tracking and Bug Reporting System

This system allows users, testers, and developers to log, track, prioritize, and resolve issues/bugs efficiently.

## Collaboration Rules
- **Pull Requests (PRs)** must be reviewed by at least one team member.
- No direct commits to the **`main`** branch (use PRs only).
- Each commit message should follow a convention:
  - `feat`: add issue submission form
  - `fix`: resolve login bug
  - `docs`: update README
  - `test`: add AI validation tests
